# PatentFileSystem
This is an online application related to filing patents in seamless manner built using JEE7 on the back-end, JSP as front-end, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework. <br>
MySQL was used as a database. I built the application using Eclipse and hosted it on the local server using Apache Tomcat.

<b>The system used four tables in the database: </b> <br>
i. Client: This table stores all the client related details. Clients are the people who file the patents in the system.
<br>
ii. Examiner: This table stores all the examiner related details. Examiners are those examine the patent request filed by the client and take necessary actions.
<br>
iii. Requests: This table stores all the patent request related information. These details are verified by the examiner during verification process.
<br>
iv. Comments: This table stores all the comments posted by the examiner and the client. Comments are generally posted on a particular patent request to gather more information or for getting more clarity.
